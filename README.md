The course was based on Python version 3.5 and Django version 1.10 but I upgraded the code and now it is based on Python==3.10 and Django==4.0.6

Steps to use the Project:
1) make a folder for the project
2) clone the project or download zip file and extract in that folder
3) make a virtual environment
4) run pip install -r requirements.txt for windows or python -m pip install requirements.txt for mac
5) make the migrations, migrate and runserver.
